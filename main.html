	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Your task is to create an HTML document that describes the concepts of Time Complexity and Space Complexity. The document must adhere to the following structure and content:</P>
	<table >
       <tr> 
	 <th>Element</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	<th>Count</th>
	<th>Keywords</th>
	   </tr>
	<tr>
	<td>h1</td>
	<td>Heading for the document </td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>Time, Space, Complexity</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>p</td>
	<td>First paragraph explaining Time Complexity </td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>Time complexity, efficient</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>p</td>
	<td>Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity </td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>Space Complexity, O(n)<td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>h1</td>
	<td>Bold text within the second paragraph </td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>	Space Complexitytd>
	</tr>
	</table>
	<h3>Instructions:</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>The h1 element must include the words Time, Space, and Complexity.</li>
	<li>The first paragraph must contain information about Time Complexity, including the words 'Time complexity' and 'efficient.'</li>
	<li>The second paragraph must contain information about Space Complexity, including the words 'Space Complexity' and 'O(n).'</li>
	<li>Within the second paragraph, the text 'Space Complexity' should be bold.</li>
	</ol>
    <p>Note: Make sure to include exactly two paragraphs with appropriate h1 and b tags as described above. Follow the given structure and content to ensure your solution aligns with the requirements.
