	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, it is a measure of the efficiency of the algorithm.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs. The space complexity of a program or algorithm is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm to execute a program and produce output. <b>Space Complexity</b> is sometimes ignored because the space used is minimal and doesn't grow with input size, like time complexity.</p>
